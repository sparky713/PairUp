A positive, affirming space for adolescents and young adults to come and relieve their stress through connecting with other members of the PearUp community

# Inspiration

Have you ever felt frustrated and wanted to vent, but felt hesitant to talk to friends or family members? Our project was motivated by this challenge that many of us face while dealing with stress, especially in the midst of global events such as the pandemic and war that have a high social impact.

# Challenges we faced

Our team consisted of designers and developers with minimal experience in web development and beginners to hackathons.  However, with our passion to learn, we decided to step out of our comfort zone and build a mobile application using a framework, **React Native**, and learning from scratch. 

Translating the prototype and design as well as allowing different react components to communicate with each other was one of the hardest aspects of our project and in turn, we were left with little to complete our **design**.

# What’s next?

Our team members are hoping to continue learning React Native and backend development to bring **PearUp** to life as a fully-functioning mobile application with added functionality! Although we were not able to fully implement the code, our design is nearly complete and we have started the coding for the frontend. PearUp’s journey has just begun and so have our designers’ and developers’.
